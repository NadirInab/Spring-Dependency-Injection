# Spring-Dependency-Injection 
### Before we dive into IOC container in spring, let's have a general overall view of What is Dependecy Injection in a simple and general terms :
#### First of all DI is a design pattern and a fundamental concept in software development, particularly in object-oriented programming. It's a technique that promotes loose coupling between different components or classes in a software system, making the code more modular, maintainable, and easier to test.
#### dependency injection refers to the process of providing the required dependencies (objects or services) that a class or component needs to function correctly, rather than letting the class create those dependencies itself. These dependencies are typically passed to the class from an external source, such as a configuration file, a framework, or another class responsible for managing the dependencies. Here are some keys aspect of why DI is very importatnt :
