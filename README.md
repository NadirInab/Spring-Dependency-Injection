### Before we dive into IOC & DI, let's take a moment to have a clear understanding of what is SPRING üëá: 

- Spring is a popular open-source framework for building enterprise applications in Java. Developed by Pivotal Software (a division of VMware).
- the Spring Framework provides comprehensive infrastructure support, making it easier to develop robust and maintainable Java applications.
- It provide many Key features and components such as : Inversion of Control (IoC), Dependency Injection (DI), Data Access, Transaction Management, Data Access, Model-View-Controller (MVC), Security, Spring Boot ... .


# Spring-Dependency-Injection 
### let's have a general overall view of What is Dependecy Injection in a simple and general terms :
#### First of all DI is a design pattern and a fundamental concept in software development, particularly in object-oriented programming.
- It's a technique that promotes loose coupling between different components or classes in a software system, making the code more modular, maintainable, and easier to test.

- dependency injection refers to the process of providing the required dependencies (objects or services) that a class or component needs to function correctly, rather than letting the class create those dependencies itself. 
- These dependencies are typically passed to the class from an external source, such as a configuration file, a framework, or another class responsible for managing the dependencies

#### Here are some keys aspect of why DI is very importatnt üíØ : 

- **Loose Coupling ‚õìÔ∏è:**

#### In general it's  a design principle that promotes independence between software modules. In the context of Spring and Dependency Injection (DI), it refers to reducing the degree of dependency between components or classes.
---
- **Flexibility: ‚ôªÔ∏è **

 Loose coupling allows for greater flexibility in the codebase. Changes in one module do not heavily impact other modules, making the system more adaptable to modifications.
 
---
 
- **Maintainability: üè∞**

Decoupled modules are easier to maintain, as alterations or enhancements to one module are less likely to affect the entire system.

---

- **Testability:** 

Facilitating isolation of behavior for unit testing.

### What is Inversion of Control (IoC) ‚ùì:
In traditional programming, developers have control over the flow of the application. They create and manage objects, and the application follows the logic written by the developer.
IoC is a paradigm shift where control over the application's flow is inverted. Instead of developers controlling the creation and management of objects, this control is handed over to a framework or container.

### Types of Dependency Injection  ü§î:

#### Constructor Injection
##### Constructor injection involves injecting dependencies through the constructor of a class. It is considered a robust and preferred way of injecting dependencies, as it ensures that a class instance is fully initialized when it is created.

```java

public class UserService {
    private final UserRepository userRepository;

    public UserService(UserRepository userRepository) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
    }
}

```

### Setter Injection
#### Setter injection involves injecting dependencies through setter methods. This provides flexibility and allows changing dependencies at runtime.

```java

public class ProductService {
    private ProductRepository productRepository;

    public void setProductRepository(ProductRepository productRepository) {
        this.productRepository = productRepository;
    }
}

```

### Field injection
#### It involves injecting dependencies directly into fields of a class 

```java

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class OrderService {
    
    @Autowired
    private PaymentService paymentService;
}

```

#### Why is not recomended to use field injection ü§î ‚ùì  
- Cyclic Dependency Risks üîÅ
- Testing Challenges ü•µ

### Dependency Injection in Spring Configuration:
In a Spring application, dependencies are often configured in the Spring configuration files (XML or Java-based) or through annotations. before we dive into example first of all let's understand few annotations that spring provide in order to simplifies the process of configuartion : 

# Spring Annotations Quick Reference

### Why do we use Annotation ‚ùì

- Annotations in Java, and specifically in the context of the Spring framework, serve various purposes to enhance and simplify the development of applications.

---

### What is Component Scanning ‚ùì

- Component scanning is the process by which Spring identifies classes with stereotype annotations (like @Component) and creates bean definitions for them.

- Spring uses component scanning to automatically discover and register components in the application context.

---

### What are stereotype annotations ‚ùì

- In the context of Spring Framework, stereotype annotations are a group of annotations that define and identify certain types of components. These annotations provide metadata about the roles of annotated classes in the application..


## @Component 

 Marks a class as a Spring component, enabling automatic detection and registration as a bean in the Spring context.

```java

@Component
public class MyComponent {
    // ... class definition
}

```

---

## @Repository 

 Indicates that a class is a Data Access Object (DAO) and is eligible for exception translation.

```java

@Repository
public class MyRepository {
    // ... class definition
}

```

---


## @Service 

 Marks a class as a service component in the business layer.

```java

@Service
public class MyService {
    // ... class definition
}

```

---

## @Controller 

 Marks a class as a controller in the presentation layer.
 
```java

@Controller
public class MyController {
    // ... class definition
}


```

## @Autowired 

Used for automatic dependency injection. It can be applied to fields, methods, and constructors.
 
```java

@Service
public class MyService {
    @Autowired
    private MyRepository repository;

}
```
----

#### Quick Recap üëå:

Annotations in Spring serve as metadata that provides additional information to the Spring IoC container or other components. They enhance the configuration, modularity, and manageability of Spring applications.


### Spring Scopes ‚úÖ

- In Spring, a bean's scope defines the lifecycle and visibility of that bean within the Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container. Different scopes are designed to meet various requirements in terms of object instantiation.

### Singleton 

- Only one instance of the bean is created, and it is shared across the entire Spring container.

###  Prototype

- A new instance of the bean is created every time it is requested.
- This is useful for handling mutable data specific to individual requests.


### Request

- A new instance of the bean is created for each HTTP request in a web application.
- suitable for handling request-specific data like form submissions.

### Session

- A new instance of the bean is created for each HTTP session in a web application.
- suitable for user-specific data that persists across multiple requests.


### Concluion
Understanding IoC, DI, and leveraging the Spring framework empowers developers to create software that is modular, maintainable, and scalable üíØ.
